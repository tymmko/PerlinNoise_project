# Perlin Noise Project

## Overview
The Perlin Noise Project is a comprehensive exploration of Perlin noise, a type of gradient noise often used in computer graphics, games, and procedural content generation. This project demonstrates the application of Perlin noise in various simulations and visualizations.

## Goal
Create a web application with the ability to generate 3D landscape and noise with specified color or gradient parameters, weight, map size, map breakdown and detail

## Features
- **Interactive Visualizations**: See real-time effects of Perlin noise on different graphical representations.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust parameters to observe how they influence the noise generation and visualization.
- **Demonstrations in Different Contexts**: Examples showing the use of Perlin noise in scenarios like terrain generation, texture creation, and more.
